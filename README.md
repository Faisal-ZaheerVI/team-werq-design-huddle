# Student Design Huddle

## Problem Statement
We are producing too much waste. Young consumers, specifically college students, are buying products & food items that are convenient and that they can afford. ( After research we will expand on this more)

Question: How can we, as college students, cut back on waste? Young adults have the lowest income bracket, with the highest spend percentage.  How can we reduce general waste; especially as college kids, many on campus people produce tons of waste at move in and move out.
